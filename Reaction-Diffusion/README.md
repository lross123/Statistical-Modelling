<H1>Analytical Solutions</H1>


The code 2.6.jl, 2.14.jl and 2.15.jl corrosponds to the three canonical analytical solutions to the diffusion equations where in each of these Jupyter Notebooks (which has been written in Julia code) the analytical solution has been plotted and the time of the simulation has been varied. 


<H1>Numerical Solutions</H1>


All three of the canonical analytic solutions were discretised spatially and temporally discretised by performing discrete-finite methods for the spatial discretisation and Heun's method for temporal discretisation. 

The discretisation of the diffusion equation with visuals of this for the three analytic solutions can be found in [].


<H1>Mathematical Derivations</H1>

Mathematical derivations of the analytical solutions from the PDE as well as the discretisation of the analytical solutions can be found in the markdown file [].
